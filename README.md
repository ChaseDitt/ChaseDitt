ðŸ”¬ Iâ€™m currently learning how to be a better programmer at the University of Iowa. I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering with a focus in Software Engineering. I am currently in my fourth year and expect to graduate in May 2024.

ðŸŒ±Outside of the coding world I love to bide my time with music. I am currently in the Hawkeye Marching Band where I get to participate in many performances and fine-tune my musical expertise.
